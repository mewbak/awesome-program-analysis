Intermediate Representation Forms/Types
=======================================

* Imperative
* Functional
  * Static Single-Assignment (SSA) - As argued by Appel, SSA is a functional representation.
  * (Lambda-)Functional
  * Continuation-passing Style (CPS)

SSA Form
========

Types:
* Fully maximal
  * Defined e.g. by Appel:
    > A really crude approach is to split every variable at every basic-
    > block boundary, and put φ-functions for every variable in every block.
    Maximal form is the most intuitive form for construction, gives the simplest
    algorithms for both phi insertion and variable renaming phases of the
    construction.
* Optimized maximal
  * An obvious optimization of avoiding placing phi functions in blocks with
    a single predecessor, as they never needed there. While cuts the number
    of phi functions, makes renaming algorithm a bit more complex: while for
    maximal form renaming could process blocks in arbitrary order (because
    each of program's variables has a local definition in every basic block),
    optimized maximal form requires processing predecessor first for each
    such single-predecessor block.
* Minimal
  * This is usually what's sought for SSA form, where there're no superflous
    phi functions, based only on graph properties of the CFG (with consulting
    semantics of the underlying program).
* Pruned
  * Minimal form can still have dead phi functions, i.e. phi functions which
    reference variables which are not actually used in the rest of the program.
    Note that such references are problematic, as they artificially extend live
    ranges of referenced variables. Likewise, it defines new variables which
    aren't really live. The pruned SSA form is devoid of the dead phi functions.
    Two obvious way to achieve this: a) perform live variable analysis prior to
    SSA construction and use it to avoid placing dead phi functions; b) run
    dead code elimination (DCE) pass after the construction (which requires
    live variable analysis first, this time on SSA form of the program already).
    Due to these additional passes, pruned SSA construction is more expensive
    than just the minimal form. Note that if we intend to run DCE pass on the
    program anyway, which is often happens, we don't really need to be concerned
    to *construct* pruned form, as we will get it after the DCE pass "for free".
    Except of course that minimal and especially maximal form require more
    space to store and more time to go thru it during DCE.
* Semi-pruned
  * Sometimes called "Briggs-Minimal" form. A compromise between fully
    pruned and minimal form. From Wikipedia:
    > Semi-pruned SSA form[6] is an attempt to reduce the number of Φ
    functions without incurring the relatively high cost of computing
    live variable information. It is based on the following observation:
    if a variable is never live upon entry into a basic block, it never
    needs a Φ function. During SSA construction, Φ functions for any
    "block-local" variables are omitted.

Summing up: There's one and true SSA type - the maximal one. It has a
straightforward, easy to understand construction algorithm which does
not dependent on any other special algorithms. Running a generic
DCE algorithm on it will remove any redundancies of the maximal form
(oftentimes, together with other dead code). All other types are
nothing but optimizations of the maximal forms, allowing to generate
less phi functions, so less are removed later. Optimizations are useful,
but the usual warning about premature optimization applies.

History
-------

* 1969

According to Aycock/Horspool:

> The genesis of SSA form was in the 1960s with the work of Shapiro and
Saint [23,19]. Their conversion algorithm was based upon finding equivalence
classes of variables by walking the control-flow graph.

R. M. Shapiro and H. Saint. The Representation of Algorithms. Rome Air
Development Center TR-69-313, Volume II, September 1969.

> Given the possibility of concurrent operation, we might also wish to question the automatic one-one mapping of variable names to equipment locations. Two uses of the same variable name might be entirely unrelated in terms of data dependency and thus potentially concurrent if mapped to different equipment locations.

Continues on the p.31 of the paper (p.39 of the PDF) under the title:

> VI. Variable-Names and Data Dependency Relations

* 1988

Then, following Wikipedia, "SSA was proposed by Barry K. Rosen, Mark N. Wegman, and F. Kenneth Zadeck in 1988."

### For Reducible CFGs (i.e. special case)

* 1986 R. Cytron, A. Lowry, K. Zadeck. Code Motion of Control Structures in High-Level
  Languages. Proceedings of the Thirteenth Annual ACM Symposium on Principles
  of Programming Languages, 1986, pp. 70–85.

  > Cytron, Lowry, and Zadeck [11] predate the use of φ-functions, and employ
  a heuristic placement policy based on the interval structure of the control-flow
  graph, similar to that of Rosen, Wegman, and Zadeck [22]. The latter work is
  interesting because they look for the same patterns as our algorithm does during
  our minimization phase. However, they do so after generating SSA form, and
  then only to correct ‘second order effects’ created during redundancy elimination.

* 1994 Single-Pass Generation of Static Single-Assignment Form for Structured Languages, Brandis and Mössenböck

  > Brandis and Mössenböck [5] generate SSA form in one pass for structured control-
  flow graphs, a subset of reducible control-flow graphs, by delicate placement of
  φ-functions. They describe how to extend their method to reducible control-flow
  graphs, but require the dominator tree to do so.

* 2000 Simple Generation of Static Single-Assignment Form, 2000, John Aycock and Nigel Horspool

  > In this paper we present a new, simple method
  for converting to SSA form, which produces correct solutions for nonre-
  ducible control-flow graphs, and produces minimal solutions for reducible
  ones.

  contribute to a solution.

  > Braun, et al present a simple SSA construction algorithm, which allows
  direct translation from an abstract syntax tree or bytecode into an
  SSA-based intermediate representation. The algorithm requires no prior
  analysis and ensures that even during construction the intermediate representation
  is in SSA form. This allows the application of SSA-based optimizations
  during construction. After completion, the intermediate representation
  is in minimal and pruned SSA form. In spite of its simplicity,
  the runtime of the algorithm is on par with Cytron et al.’s algorithm.

Control Flow Analysis
=====================

According to 1997 Muchnick:

* Analysis on "raw" graphs, using dominators, the iterative dataflow algorithms
* Interval Analysis, which then allows to use adhoc optimized dataflow analysis.
  Variants in the order of advanceness:
  * The simplest form is T1-T2 reduction
  * Maximal intervals analysis
  * Minimal intervals analysis
  * Structural analysis
